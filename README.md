# Digital Dice in Python

Python-based solutions to the puzzles in Nahin, P., <i>Digital Dice: Computational Solutions to Practical Probability Problems, 2e</i>. This is an attempt to write Monte-Carlo solvers in Python with reasonable performance, using only NumPy, SciPy and the standard library (e.g. no Cython or Numba).

## List of Problems:

1. The Clumsy Dishwasher
2. Will Alice and Bob Meet at the Malt Shop?
3. A Parallel Parking Problem
4. A Curious Coin Game
